# Home Automation Server

This is the source code of our hardware mod for the Rollotron 1800 by Rademacher. It uses the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi Zero W and some sketchy soldering to access the hardware buttons. This makes it possible to control the shutter via a *beautiful* webinterface, enabling the user to stay in bed indefinitely.

### Prerequisites

```
Apache
Python3
Tmux
```
### Installation

1. Install a [Raspbian Image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) on the Pi Zero.

2. Clone the project onto the Raspberry Pi and cd into the root directory.

3. Run

    ```
    ./installationscript.sh
    ```

4.
