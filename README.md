# Home Automation Server

This is the source code of our hardware mod for the Rollotron 1800 by Rademacher. It uses the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi Zero W and some sketchy soldering to access the hardware buttons. This makes it possible to control the shutter via a *beautiful* webinterface, enabling the user to stay in bed indefinitely.

### Prerequisites

```
Apache
Python3
Tmux
```

### Installing

1. Clone the project and cd into the root directory

2. To install the needed python packages run
